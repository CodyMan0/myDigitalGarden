CUI stands for **Character User Interface**. It is a user interface where the user interacts with the computer solely through the keyboard and requires a command to perform any task. CUI is the precursor of GUI and was utilized in most of the early computers. **Most computers use GUI rather than CUI**. It works by permitting the user to provide commands to a program in multiple text lines **(command lines)**. CUIs basic instances are **MS-DOS** and the **Windows Command Prompt**. One of the CUI's applications is that it simplifies the creation of programming scripts.
